# sublime-settings

###### Nik's Sublime Text 3 stuff

Nothing groundbreaking here: I got tired of maintaining gists and figured this might be a better place to keep these, since I tend to share settings between work and personal computers.

## "Automation"

After installing ST3 and Package Control, run this:

`ln -s ~/Projects/sublime-settings/Package\ Control.sublime-settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/Package\ Control.sublime-settings && ln -s ~/Projects/sublime-settings/Preferences.sublime-settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings && ln -s ~/Projects/sublime-settings/SublimeLinter.sublime-settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User/SublimeLinter.sublime-settings`
